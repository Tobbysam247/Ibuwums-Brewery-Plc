# üçª IBUWUMS Brewery Plc: Profit & Brand Performance Analysis (2017‚Äì2019)

## Project Story

**"How profitable is a brewery in West Africa"? "Which territories consume more beer"? "Which brands dominate the market"?** These were the key business questions I set out to answer through data.

This project tells the story of IBUWUMS Brewery Plc, an FMCG company operating across Anglophone and Francophone West African countries, by analyzing three years of sales and profit data: 2017, 2018, and 2019.

## The Journey: From Excel to Insights

The dataset was provided in Excel, along with a set of over 20+ targeted business questions. Rather than jump straight into visualization, I took the following structured approach:

### Step 1: Data Cleaning in Excel
The raw dataset contained mixed columns, inconsistent dates, and missing values. I:
- Standardized dates and currencies,
- Cleaned product names,
- Filled missing values appropriately.

### Step 2: SQL for Analysis
I exported the cleaned dataset to MySQL Workbench where I:
- Queried the data to extract meaningful KPIs,
- Answered each of the 20+ business questions using aggregate functions, joins, and date filters,
- Exported each result as a `.csv`.

### Step 3: Power BI Dashboard Design
I merged all the `.csv` files into a single Excel workbook with 21 sheets. Then in Power BI, I:
- Created relationships where necessary,
- Designed three storytelling dashboards,
- Applied consistent formatting, icons, and callouts for business clarity.

   - Territory performance (Anglophone vs Francophone)
   - Profit trends across years
   - Top brands per country

2. **Brand-Level & Country Performance**
   - Monthly profit contributions (%)
   - Beer brand comparison in Nigeria
   - Francophone consumer preferences
   - Country-level profitability

3. **Product & Sales Focus**
   - Budweiser regional consumption and sales
   - Top salespeople
   - Best-performing brand per region
   - National beer consumption breakdown

## Recommendations

**Leverage High-Performing Territories:**  
Focus expansion efforts on Anglophone markets, which account for nearly 60% of profits.

**Promote in Low-Performing Months:**  
Introduce sales promotions in April and December, which historically record lower profits.

**Senegal = High Opportunity:**  
With the highest beer consumption, Senegal is ideal for launching new products or upscaling distribution.

**Optimize Budweiser Distribution:**  
Consumption is highest in the West, but regional sales show gaps in the South East ‚Äî suggesting a need for better alignment between demand and supply.

**Brand Growth Strategy:**  
Brands like Hero and Castle Lite are dominating across regions. Consider bundling or cross-promotions with malt products like Grand Malt in underperforming zones.
